# Regressions
*This repository goes into demonstating simple linear regression models.
*The repository has pdf files to make it simple to visualise what a report based off of simple linear regression would look like.
*The code in notebooks generate graphs and fir models on test data to also check the accuracy and eventual usability of the model.


Important Note:
The notebooks are written in a report format therefore code lines are explained as you navigate through the notebook
